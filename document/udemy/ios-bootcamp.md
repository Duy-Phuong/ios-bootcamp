When you click a file in the left pane, the right pane updates to provide an editor suitable for the selected file. For `*.h and *.m` source code files, a traditional source code text editor is presented, but other file types (such as `*.xib` resource files) have more complex graphical editors associated with them.

For now, let’s focus on understanding the general structure of an Objective-C–based project. Objective-C is an object-oriented language, meaning that a large portion of your coding efforts will be spent defining new classes (types of objects). [Listing 1.1](https://livebook.manning.com/book/objective-c-fundamentals/chapter-1/ch01list01) defines a new class called CoinTossViewController. By convention, the definition of a class is kept in a header file that uses a `*.h` file extension.

A header (`*.h`) file specifies what you can expect a class to contain and how other code should interact with it. Now that you’ve updated the header file, you must provide the actual implementation of the features you’ve specified. Open the matching Coin-TossViewController.m file, and replace its contents with that of the following listing.

`*.m`: Logic of code and import file `*.h`
